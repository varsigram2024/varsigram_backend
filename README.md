        }
        ```
    *   Response (500 Internal Server Error): If an error occurs.
        ```json
        {
            "detail": "Error fetching posts."
        }
        ```

**Notes:**
- The endpoint returns posts sorted by `timestamp` (most recent first).
- Pagination is handled via the `start_after` query parameter and `next_cursor` in the response.
- Each post includes hydrated author information in the response context.
- Only organizations with `exclusive=True` are included.
- If authenticated, the `has_liked` field reflects whether the current user has liked each post.

**NOTIFICATION DATA PAYLOAD**

## I. Standard Payload Fields

All notifications contain these fields, with the required values being context-specific. The client should primarily use the **`type`** field to determine the necessary routing logic.

| Field Name | Type | Description | Purpose for Client Routing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`type`** | `string` | Defines the specific **event** that occurred (e.g., `'comment'`, `'like'`, `'follow'`, `'new_post'`). | **Primary discriminator** for client-side routing logic. |
| **`post_id`** | `string` | The **Firestore ID** of the target post. | Used to build the deep-link path: `/posts/:post_id`. |
| **`comment_id`** | `string` | The **Firestore ID** of a new comment or reply. | **Contextual cue**: Used to scroll to or highlight the specific comment on the Post Screen. |
| **`follower_id`** | `string` | The **PostgreSQL ID** of the user who initiated a follow. | Used for redirection to a User Profile Screen: `/profile/:user_id`. |
| **`commenter_id` / `liker_id`** | `string` | PostgreSQL ID of the user who performed the action. | Used for display or secondary profile lookup. |

---

## II. Client Redirection Logic by Event Type

The client application's router should switch on the value of the **`type`** field to determine the correct target route.

### 1. New Comment or Reply (`type: 'comment'` or `'reply'`)

This notification redirects the user to the parent post and highlights the new comment.

| Field Used | Action | Client Route Structure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`post_id`** | Direct to the Post Screen. | `/posts/:post_id` |
| **`comment_id`** | Pass as a query parameter for scrolling/highlighting. | `?commentId=:comment_id` |

**Example Server Payload:**
```json
{
    "type": "comment",
    "post_id": "fskj34klj5h6g7f8d9s0a1",
    "comment_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1",
    "commenter_id": "23456789-abcd-efgh-ijkl-1234567890ab"
}

### 2. Post Like or New Post (type: 'like' or 'new_post')

These actions redirect the user directly to the target post.

Field Used	Action	Client Route Structure
post_id	Direct to the Post Screen.	/posts/:post_id


**Example Server Payload (Like):**


```json
{
    "type": "like",
    "post_id": "fskj34klj5h6g7f8d9s0a1",
    "liker_id": "23456789-abcd-efgh-ijkl-1234567890ab" 
}

### 3. New Follow (type: 'follow')

This action redirects the user to the profile of the user who initiated the follow (the follower).

Field Used	Action	Client Route Structure
follower_display_name_slug	Direct to the User Profile Screen.	/profile/:follower_display_name_slug


**Example Server Payload:**

```json
{
    "type": "follow",
    "follower_id": "12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-000000000001",
    "follower_name": "ashdcugwiugwrf",
    "follower_display_name_slug": "dshwydyd-1"
}

## III. Client Implementation Notes
- Prioritization: The client should prioritize deep-linking based on the presence of the necessary ID fields. The check should prioritize follower_id for 'follow' events, and post_id for all others.

- Route Construction: The client must dynamically construct the route path, appending optional query parameters (?commentId=...) only when the corresponding ID is present.

- Fallback: If the notification data lacks the required ID for a deep link, the application should fall back to a safe route, such as the main /notifications screen or the Home Feed.



### Point Submission (RewardPointCreateView)

    1. Reward Point Submission (UPSERT)
This endpoint allows an authenticated user to submit points (a reward) to a post, initiating a transaction that is validated against Firestore data before being saved to the local database.

Detail	Specification
Name	reward-submit
URL	/api/v1/reward-points/

}
Data Flow Summary (on POST)
Serializer receives post_id and points.

Serializer calls Firebase SDK with post_id to retrieve the post's author_id (local Postgres ID).

Serializer enforces the 1-5 point limit.

Transaction is saved/updated in the Postgres RewardPointTransaction table, linking the giver, the firestore_post_id, and the denormalized post_author.

Field	Type	Description
id	integer	The local ID (pk) of the user whose score is being returned.
username	string	The username of the user.
total_points_received	integer	The total number of points received from all rewards across all their posts.
